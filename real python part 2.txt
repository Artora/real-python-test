CMD COMMANDS

cd - navigating to folders
cd .. - going back one folder
dir - listing folder contents
cls - clear the screen
del - delete a file
md - create new folder
rd - remove a folder
echo file_content > file_name - create new file


INSTALLING SQLITE

VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

# create a new directory "venv" and set up a virtual environment within that directory
python -m venv env

# activate the virtual environment:
env\scripts\activate
source env/Scripts/activate

# deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate

Every time you create a new project, install a new virtual environment.

# install python packages and get packages and version info into a text file
$ pip install flask==0.11.1
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

Make sure to add a .gitignore file to the "flasktaskr" directory:
env
venv
*.pyc
__pycache__
*.DS_Store
project/_config.py

CHROME

press ctrl + shift + I to activate developer tools

VERSION CONTROL

We will be using Git for version control and Github for remotely hosting our code.

SETTING UP Git

git-scm.com/downloads/

read chapter 2 and 3 of the Git Book:
git-scm.com/book/

Add the repo on Github. Run the following commands in your local directory:
$ git init
$ touch README.md # creates a file
$ git add -A # takes a snapshot of the project in its current state
$ git commit -m "some message" # adds the project to your repo
$ git remote add origin https:// # adds the project to GitHub
$ git push origin master # PUSHes the local repo to Github


Next, after your repo has been created locally and remotely - and you completed your
first PUSH - you can follow this similar workflow to PUSH as needed:
$ git add -A # takes a snapshot of the project in its current state
$ git commit -am 'message'
$ git push origin master


Next add a .gitignore file (no file extension!), which is a file that you can use to specify
files you wish to ignore or keep out of your repository, both local and remote. What files
should you keep out? If it's clutter (such as a .pyc file) or a secret (such as an API key),
then keep it out of your public repo on Github.
Please read more about .gitignore here. For now, add the files found here.
git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore

set up RSA key for use with Github so you don't have to enter password each time you push code to Github
https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


YOUR SETUP
# Finally, we want to set up a requirements.txt file for each virtual environment. This file contains a list of packages you've installed via pip. This is meant to be used by other developers to recreate the same development environment. To do this, run the following command when your virtual environment is activated:
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

1.4 FLASK: QUICK START

Save the file as app.py and run it:
$ python app.py
open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in browser to see the webpage

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
http://localhost:5000


1.5 INTERLUDE: DATABASE PROGRAMMING
SQL AND SQLite BASICS

The 4 basic SQL commands:
SELECT - retrieves data from the database
INSERT - inserts data from the database
UPDATE - updates data from the database
DELETE - deletes data from the database



##########################
WHEN STARTING AGAIN AFTER STARTING PC, DO THE FOLLOWING:

# 1. OPEN GIT BASH

# 2. NAVIGATE TO FOLDER
$ cd /D/Sync/python/real-python-test/

$ cd Desktop/omat\ tiedostot/python/real\ python/book\ 2/real-python-test/flasktaskr/


# 3. ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
$ source env/Scripts/activate

# 4. MERGING UPDATES FROM GitHub TO OWN PC
$ git pull origin master

# 5. UPDATING GitHub
$ git add -A # takes a snapshot of the project in its current state
$ git commit -am 'message'
$ git push origin master

##########################

# To change the drive in Windows cmd
cd /d D:\Sync\python\real-python-test\debugging

SQL Summary

Basic SQL syntax...

Insert

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

Update

UPDATE table_name
SET column1=value1
WHERE some_column=some_value;

Delete

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE some_column=some_value;

1.5 FLASK BLOG APP

start server by running:
python blog.py (chnage filename to what you want to run)
then open page localhost:5000 in browser
http://localhost:5000/


WARNING: Make the value of your secret key really, really hard, if not impossible,
to guess. Use a random key generator to do this. Never, ever use a value you pick
on your own. Or you can use your OS to get a random string:
>>> import os
>>> os.urandom(24)
'rM\xb1\xdc\x12o\xd6i\xff+9$T\x8e\xec\x00\x13\x82.*\x16TG\xbd'
Now you can simply assign that string to the secret key: SECRET_KEY =
rM\xb1\xdc\x12o\xd6i\xff+9$T\x8e\xec\x00\x13\x82.*\x16TG\xbd


1.7 Interlude: Debugging in Python

pdb module

From here you step through your code to see what happens, line by line. You have access to a number of commands, which can be daunting at first, but on a day-to-day basis you'll only use a few of them:
	n : step forward one line
	p <variable name> : prints the current value of the provided variable
	l : displays the entire program along with where the current break point is
	q : exits the debugger and the program
	c : exits the debugger and the program continues to run
	b <line #> : adds a breakpoint at a specific line #
NOTE If you don't remember the list of commands you can always type ? or help to see the entire list.

page 201 COVERAGE

$ pip install coverage==4.2
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

$ coverage run test.py

$ coverage report --omit=../env/'*'
$ coverage html --omit=../env/'*'

NOTE: If you get stuck with coverage, try calling coverage erase and starting
over. Each time you run coverage run test.py , coverage remembers and is
basing its calculations on the state of the test suite at that point. Changes to the
code may make it necessary to erase coverage and start fresh.


PAGE 204 NOSE

$ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-erase --cover-package=../project

Let's look at the flags that we used:
1. --with-coverage checks for test coverage.
2. --cover-erase erases coverage results from the previous test run.
3. --cover-package==../project specifies which portion of the code to analyze.

HEROKU

heroku path:
/C/Users/artomatti.ratilainen/Desktop/omat\ tiedostot/heroku/bin/heroku

to login copy paste in git bash:
/C/Users/artomatti.ratilainen/Desktop/omat\ tiedostot/heroku/bin/heroku login

create app on Heroku
$ heroku create

confirm the heroku exists on git
$ git remote -v

if not:
	look the name of the heroku when creating app, for example:
	hidden-sands-78899

	create  the heroku git:
	$ heroku git:remote -a thawing-inlet-61413

Deploy your code to Heroku:
	- to deploy the entire repo:
	$ git push heroku master

	to deploy a subfolder of a repo:
	$ git subtree push --prefix flasktaskr heroku master

Add a PostgreSQL database:
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev

Check to make sure your app is running:
$ heroku ps

View the app in your browser:
$ heroku open

If you see errors, open the Heroku log to view all errors and output:
$ heroku logs

Push only flasktaskr folder to heroku:
$ git subtree push --prefix flasktaskr heroku master

Run nosetests:
$ heroku run nosetests
$ heroku logs --app hidden-sands-78899 --dyno run.2030


	RESTful API
	page 264
Put simply, an API is collection of functions that other programs can use to access or
manipulate data from a determine database. Each function has an associated endpoint
(also called a resource). One can make changes to a resource via the HTTP
methods/verbs:
1. GET - view a resource
2. POST - create a new resource
3. PUT - update a resource
4. DELETE - delete a resource
