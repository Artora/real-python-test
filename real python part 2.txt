CMD COMMANDS

cd - navigating to folders

ISNTALLING SQLITE

VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

# create a new directory "venv" and set up a virtual environment within that directory
python -m venv env

# activate the virtual environment:
env\scripts\activate
source env/Scripts/activate

# deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate

Every time you create a new project, install a new virtual environment.

CHROME

press ctrl + shift + I to activate developer tools

VERSION CONTROL

We will be using Git for version control and Github for remotely hosting our code.

SETTING UP Git

git-scm.com/downloads/

read chapter 2 and 3 of the Git Book:
git-scm.com/book/

Add the repo on Github. Run the following commands in your local directory:
$ git init
$ touch README.md # creates a file
$ git add -A # takes a snapshot of the project in its current state
$ git commit -m "some message" # adds the project to your repo
$ git remote add origin https:// # adds the project to GitHub
$ git push origin master # PUSHes the local repo to Github


Next, after your repo has been created locally and remotely - and you completed your
first PUSH - you can follow this similar workflow to PUSH as needed:
$ git add -A # takes a snapshot of the project in its current state
$ git commit -am 'message'
$ git push origin master


Next add a .gitignore file (no file extension!), which is a file that you can use to specify
files you wish to ignore or keep out of your repository, both local and remote. What files
should you keep out? If it's clutter (such as a .pyc file) or a secret (such as an API key),
then keep it out of your public repo on Github.
Please read more about .gitignore here. For now, add the files found here.
git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore

set up RSA key for use with Github so you don't have to enter password each time you push code to Github
https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


YOUR SETUP
# Finally, we want to set up a requirements.txt file for each virtual environment. This file contains a list of packages you've installed via pip. This is meant to be used by other developers to recreate the same development environment. To do this, run the following command when your virtual environment is activated:
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

1.4 FLASK: QUICK START

Save the file as app.py and run it:
$ python app.py
open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in browser to see the webpage

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
http://localhost:5000


1.5 INTERLUDE: DATABASE PROGRAMMING
SQL AND SQLite BASICS

The 4 basic SQL commands:
SELECT - retrieves data from the database
INSERT - inserts data from the database
UPDATE - updates data from the database
DELETE - deletes data from the database



##########################
WHEN STARTING AGAIN AFTER STARTING PC, DO THE FOLLOWING:

# 1. OPEN GIT BASH

# 2. NAVIGATE TO FOLDER
$ cd /D/Sync/python/real-python-test/

# 3. ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
$ source env/Scripts/activate

# 4. MERGING UPDATES FROM GitHub TO OWN PC
$ git pull origin master

# 5. UPDATING GitHub
$ git add -A # takes a snapshot of the project in its current state
$ git commit -am 'message'
$ git push origin master

##########################

SQL Summary

Basic SQL syntax...

Insert

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

Update

UPDATE table_name
SET column1=value1
WHERE some_column=some_value;

Delete

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE some_column=some_value;

1.5 FLASK BLOG APP

start server by running:
python blog.py (chnage filename to what you want to run)
then open page localhost:5000 in browser
http://localhost:5000/


WARNING: Make the value of your secret key really, really hard, if not impossible,
to guess. Use a random key generator to do this. Never, ever use a value you pick
on your own. Or you can use your OS to get a random string:
>>> import os
>>> os.urandom(24)
'rM\xb1\xdc\x12o\xd6i\xff+9$T\x8e\xec\x00\x13\x82.*\x16TG\xbd'
Now you can simply assign that string to the secret key: SECRET_KEY =
rM\xb1\xdc\x12o\xd6i\xff+9$T\x8e\xec\x00\x13\x82.*\x16TG\xbd
